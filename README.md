# Rocket Bus

Alexa Skill for Bus Arrival Time. (Personal Use)

## How does it work

### 1. Bus Arrival Time API

Get Bus Arrival Time API from [Data.go.kr](https://www.data.go.kr/)

### 2. Create a Lambda Function

Create a Lambda Function for Skill. The code is in the `lambda_functions` directory.

### 3. Create a Alexa Skill

Create a Alexa Skill kit and add the lambda function you created.

### 4. (For Personal Use Only)

Connect the Alexa device with the account you registered your Alexa skill. Then you don't have to publish your skill. Alexa automatically install the skill you created.

### 5. Activate Skill!!!

Say, "Alexa, Open `Skill Name`." (e.g "Alexa, Open `Rocket Bus`.") It's DONE!
